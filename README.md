# indigent-android-bitcoin

A guide to setting up a stock android device as a mobile bitcoin appliance for people with few resources. The initial target is to provide a smooth process for panhandlers to receive bitcoin tips.

## The scenario

Bitcoin has huge potential with people of little means to conduct personal banking and exchange. The barrier to entry has been helping these people understand bitcoin and finding a way to help them earn bitcoin. If these people were displayed as a list in an app, it would be easier to provide tips, wages, and gifts just by looking at their names on the screen. The bitholla app adds this functionality by providing a geolocated list of persons.

## The tools

Begin with an android device that has been factory reset and cleared of any carrier bloatware.

* Bitholla
* Reddit broswer
* Gyft
* Mycelium Wallet
* Circle Wallet (?)
* Readme file
* Introduction Video

## Device Setup

1. Turn the device on airplane mode but enable wifi.
2. Create a google account with a memorable name and secure password. I suggest making a physical copy of this username and password and somehow pasting it/taping to to the outside of the device.
